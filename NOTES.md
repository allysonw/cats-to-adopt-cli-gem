# Notes and Plans

STEPS
1. Plan your gem - imagine your interface
2. Start w/project structure -google
3. Start w entry point - the file run
4. Force that to build the CLI interface
5. Stub out the interface
6. Start making things real
7. Discover objects
8. program

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

A command line interface that lists cats available to adopt within 100 miles of Los Angeles

User can select a cat to learn more details about that cat

NEXT STEPS
- [X] implement tests
- [X] write readme
- [X] check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how - you've met the requirement before you submit your project.
- [ ] Prepare a video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working gem.
- [ ] Write a blog post about the project and process.
- [ ] On Learn, submit links to the GitHub repository for your app, your video demo, and your blog post each to the corresponding - textbox in the right rail, and hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.
- [X] For bonus points, instead of just creating an application, create a gem and for extra bonus points try publishing it to RubyGems. (record coding session)
